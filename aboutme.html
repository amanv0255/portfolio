            <p>But it is not easy for me. I am a Mechanical Engineer. I have completed my B.tech from AKTU(Uttar Pradesh, India) in 2016. When I was in college, I took a saminar on robotics, form there I develop a keen interst for programming, I felt like I was a small kid and prorgraming is a toy.
